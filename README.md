# Welcome to Fehmi Ana√ß's GitHub Profile! üëã

Hello there! I'm Fehmi Ana√ß, a backend enthusiast with a focus on scalability, AWS, serverless architecture, PubSub, DynamoDB, C#, and Golang. I'm based in Istanbul, Turkey. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share my projects and explorations in these areas of interest.

## About Me

- üìß Email: fehmianac@gmail.com

A little bit about me: I specialize in building scalable backend systems using AWS, diving into serverless architectures, and working with technologies like PubSub, DynamoDB, C#, and Golang to create efficient and robust solutions.

## My Repositories

Here are some highlighted repositories you might find interesting:

1. [AWS ApiGateway Websocket Addapter](https://github.com/fehmianac/aws-web-socket-adapter)
   - The AWS API Gateway WebSocket Integration Manager is a C# project that facilitates the management of AWS API Gateway WebSocket integrations for other projects. It provides a one-click deployment process, allowing users to quickly set up and use the project in their own AWS accounts.
   - .net, DynamoDB, ApiGateway, SQS, JWT

2. [MultiCache Layer in C#](https://github.com/fehmianac/MultiCache)
   - MultiCache is a versatile library designed to address intricate caching challenges. In high-traffic applications, the distribution of caching mechanisms can lead to complications, particularly when relying on TCP sockets for each cache request. MultiCache tackles this issue by dual-caching objects, both in the Cache Server (Redis) and the server's memory. This approach optimizes subsequent requests by serving them directly from memory, enhancing performance and minimizing dependence on the Cache Server.
   - .NET, C#, Redis

3. [Serverless Chat API](https://github.com/fehmianac/serverless-chat-api)
   - The Serverless Chat API is an AWS serverless application built using .NET 6.0 and DynamoDB. It provides a scalable and efficient chat solution by leveraging the power of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This API works in conjunction with the open-source solution "AWS WebSocket Adapter," available at
